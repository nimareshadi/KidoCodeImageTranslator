# KidoCodeImageTranslator
This application is a sample code that is used as image translator for capturing images, detecting the textes(in the captured image) and translating to different languages or storing/retrieving in the collection.
In this sample we use Google Vision and Google Translator api's which consumes api's with JSON format (in next version we use Retrofit library); additionaly, ObjectBox is the main storage(database) of app that handle functions related to storing/retrieving data.
The structure of app is MVVM (Model,View,ModelView) and Material Design is used as UI principles of app ; therefore, Android Architecture Components and Appcompat are two libraries which are used to achieve these purposes.
